#A palindrome is a phrase that, if reversed, would read the exact same.
#Write code that checks if p_phrase is a palindrome by reversing it and then checking if the reversed version is equal to the original.
#Assign the reversed version of p_phrase to the variable r_phrase so that we can check your work.


p_phrase = "was it a car or a cat I saw"
r_phrase = p_phrase[::-1]
