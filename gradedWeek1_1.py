#There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with *.

xyz = 5
xyz=square(xyz)



#Write code to assign the number of characters in the string rv to a variable num_chars.

rv = "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door; Only this and nothing more."
# Write your code here!
num_chars = len(rv)
